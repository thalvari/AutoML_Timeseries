The concatenated objects may have different ts_value_colname values, result using the ts_value_colname of the first object
Sorting because non-concatenation axis is not aligned. A future version
of pandas will change to not sort by default.

To accept the future behavior, pass 'sort=False'.

To retain the current behavior and silence the warning, pass 'sort=True'.
